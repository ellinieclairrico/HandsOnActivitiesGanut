	<p> 
		Greeting! I am Ellinie Clair R. Ganut,
		a motivated 20 years old and a 2nd year 
		BSIT learner at USTP. I have a passion for 
		Information and Communications technology,
		which I pursued during my senior high school
		days. While I may only possess a basic understanding
		of computers	
	</p>
	<p> 
		I am eager and willing to learn more.
		With my dedication and commitment to my
		studies, I am confident that I will graduate
		in this course.
